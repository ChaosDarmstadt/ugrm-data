    <name>Independent Game Developers Rhein-Main</name>
    <description>This group is for everyone in the Rhein-Main area who is interested in game development and would like
        to exchange with other developers and game designers. The goal is to meet once a month, get to know each other
        and talk about various topics, e.g. frameworks and tools, marketing your game, monetization or just the love for
        game development.

                Hi,

                let's meet up again and talk about our indie game dev endeavours.

                This meetup is supposed to be a casual get-together again like last time but in a more quiet
                environment.

                Marc and Norbert from Sanid offered their office space for the next meetup.

                Since Thursday, May 1st is a holiday I thought we could meet on Friday, May 2nd at 4pm, which gives us a
                little more time to talk and maybe showcase some of the work in progress.

                cheers ali
