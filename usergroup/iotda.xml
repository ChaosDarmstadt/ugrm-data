        This is a group to develop and share knowledge in the space of Internet of Things, Microcontrollers and
        Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Smart) communication. Meetups will cover knowledge sharing and hacking
        workshops. I started this group because I want to dig deeper into this topic, and don't want to wait for other
        people creating a meetup like this. I look forward to meet like minded people who want to experiment and build
        intelligent devices and systems as well to gain and pass on knowledge.
